ToDo:
- Some details how the navigation to single workouts works evades me. Needs a detailed study.
- Learn DaggerHilt and use (if feasible) DI to reduce code duplication for viewmodels and screens
  regarding workouts <--> trainings
- Updates of Trainings and Workouts are messy and done differently in different places:
   'ExistingTrainingViewModel.kt', 'ExistingWorkoutViewModel.kt', 'DBTrainingRepository.kt',
   'DBWorkoutRepository.kt'. In particular the 'lastModified' update had to be done manual alos in
   'WorkoutUI.kt' and 'TrainingUI.kt'
- Use ExpandableFloatingActionButton
- Fix navigation after synchronisation and tell user how many entries have been synchronized

In preparation:
  - Search a workout/all workouts in a given time interval.


Possible features:
  - Review use cases and data layer:
    - Introduce "Session" that has multiple workouts??? Unclear if needed.
    - Show all workouts or a "Session" of one day (calendar access)???
    - Allow to define "breaks" between sets that automatically go to stopwatch
  - Internationalization
  - EditWorkoutScreen Add button that allows edited workout to add "as new" instead of update
  - Is it possible to show performance list in calendar?
