- Some details how the navigation to single workouts works evades me. Needs a detailed study.

- Possible features:
  - Add button that shows list of all performances for one workout/training (PURE UI)
  - Connect ROOM database with Desktop MS SQL database using RESTful API and sync user data.
  - Review use cases and data layer:
    - Introduce "Session" that has multiple workouts??? Unclear if needed.
    - Show all workouts or a "Session" of one day (calendar access)???
    - Allow to define "breaks" between sets that automatically go to stopwatch
  - Internationalization
  - EditWorkoutScreen Add button that allows edited workout to add "as new" instead of update
  - Is it possible to show performance list in calendar?
