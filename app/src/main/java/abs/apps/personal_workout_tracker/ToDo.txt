- Some details how the navigation to single workouts works evades me. Needs a detailed study.
- Clean up the string resources.
- Some code duplication could be avoided e.g. validateInput in Add- and EditWorkoutViewModel


- Missing features:
  - Internationalization ?!?
  - Date & time
      - Add timestamps (date and time) to each performance in data-layer
      - Show last performance (date-time added) in ExistingWorkoutScreen
      - Add button that shows list of all performances for one workout
      - Is it possible to show performance list in calendar?
  - After that other features
